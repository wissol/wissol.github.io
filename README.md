# Wissol, the personal blog of Miguel de Luis

This is a blog written without a Content Management System, so no PHP and no Python, just HTML5 and Sass, with a simple, minimalist structure. The main reason behind this option is that _I love code and simplicity_. I really think that 99% of what I post does not require interactivity or any of that stuff. I do love designing a game or a javascript lightbox as much as the next geek, but let's host those in their own sites. Besides that, I am a simple person. (Oh, and I like my pages to run fast, faster..)

I am also exploring the DIY approach, so no Bootstrap or any framework of that sort.
