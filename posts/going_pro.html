				<h2>
					Full-stack developer, going pro
				</h2>

				<p>
					March the 4th, 2017. It is official: <strong>I am setting myself to become a 
					full-stack web developer</strong>, a career change at 46 years old.			
				</p>

				<p>
					The why is actually simple. I have loved code since the days of the Amstrad CPC.
					I even took to Computer Science but dropped it for Law. Bad mistake, I should had
					looked for a better Computer Science school back then; but I can't put the clock
					back. However the itch for coding never died out and for the last few years I've
					become something of a well rounded amateur picking HTML, CSS3, Javascript, Python
					and bits of Ruby and Haskell, and a few frameworks and such. I have put those skills into use in my present job
					mostly with small scripts that are helping me immensely; despite its simplicity. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I think the time has come to move forward and try the bold thing of doing
					what I really like: good code that does good things well. I've enrolled into the
					Viking virtual bootcamp which it's the best I've been able to find. My immediate
					target is to polish my skills, focus on best practices, and become someone who can
					be actually useful in a team.
