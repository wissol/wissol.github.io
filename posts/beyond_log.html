				<h2>Beyond the Log</h2>

				<p>
				I have made a visibly small, yet important change on this webpage: the link
				titled <em>posts</em> is now called <em>content</em>. And the simple reason
				is that I am not only posting posts. 
				</p>

				<p>
				One of the good things of a <em>DIY</em> page is that I am free from the
				design constrains of a blogging platform or a CMS, that must be made generic
				and easy to understand for any potential user. Though, funny as it might sound,
				most blogs aren't blogs and here's why. A blog is a portmanteu of web + log. 
				Essentially, on the early days of the web, before the era of the Social Network,
				you browsed the web, found interesting links, read them and them shared your
				experience on your "web log" by inverse chronological order. These days, most 
				blogs are more akin to a magazine, or even a book, a collection of articles where
				the dates in which they were written is not essential. Even, you could even 
				say that most 'web logs' use the web as just a tool, --albeit an important one--
				not focusing on that but on gaming, politics, food or science for that matter.
				</p>

				<p>
				Serenicode could be called a blog, and I suppose I will call it that way when
				I have to explain what it is in a hurry, but it's in fact, something else: a 
				place where I share everything I have to say, not just posts. I am not stamping
				my content with a publication date, unless I find that to be relevant; most often
				it isn't. Neither, I will focus of on my web-browsing. On the positive side, I will
				update the content that needs to be updated, edit what's wrong, and delete what is
				no longer relevant or useful. That's all, for now.
