				<h2>Welcome to Wissowl</h2>

				<p>
					This <a href="">blog</a> is an experiment on caring through words. One beautiful word in caring is welcome. Welcome is much more than a hello or such other greetings. By saying welcome you do not only recognize somebody as human being and show peaceful intentions. Welcome is a blessing.
				</p>

				<p>
					Welcome welcomes you as a guest of a physical or virtual home and invites to take a seat round the hearth. Welcome conjures up images of a warm broth in a stormy night, it moves you a step into an internal circle. It says love.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, welcome, as any other word, can be used to deceive or fool. Yet that is not Welcomeâ€™s fault.
				</p>

				<p>
					Welcome is meant to be the beginning of a story of care and courage. I accept you and you accept me as co-protagonists of a new story to come. We understand that we do not know where such story would lead us to, but that we have chose to begin it with a blessing.,
